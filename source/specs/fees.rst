Transaction Fees
================

The Aergo protocol includes transaction fees that need to be paid according to the configuration of the network.

Currently, the public testnet has a fixed fee of 1 gaer. This fee may change in the future.

Sidechains can configure a custom fee. For private chains, free transactions are also possible.
