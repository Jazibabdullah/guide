Brick
=====

Brick is an interactive shell program to communicate with an aergo VM for testing.
This also provides a batch function to test and help to develop smart contracts.

The main advantage of using this tool is that you don't need a real blockchain network.
Instead, you can run operations directly in the aergo virtual machine.
