Lua
===

To create smart contracts for Aergo, you can use the `Lua scripting language <http://www.lua.org/about.html>`_.

Lua is a powerful, efficient, lightweight, embeddable scripting language.

Lua has simple procedural syntax with a powerful data description structure. it supports a variety of programming methods: Procedural programming, object-oriented programming, functional programming, etc.

We use `LuaJIT 2.0.3 <http://luajit.org/luajit.html>`_ for VM. LuaJIT is a Just-In-Time Compiler (JIT) for the Lua programming language.

You can learn the Lua programming language through the following documents
  * `Lua 5.1 Reference Manaul <http://www.lua.org/manual/5.1/>`_
  * `Programming in Lua <http://www.lua.org/pil/>`_ (The second edition was aimed at Lua 5.1)
