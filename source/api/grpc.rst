Using gRPC
==========

GRPC is a standard for RPC APIs using protobuffer messages for data exchange.
The main advantages are typed messages and efficiency: data is packed tightly and sent over HTTP2.

If you want to use the GRPC API directly, please refer to the `official documentation <https://grpc.io/>`_ to get started.

Alternatively, you can use one of the `SDKs <../sdks/index.html>`_ which wrap the same functionality in language-specific styles.
